This is the repository linked to the paper "Impacts of climate variability on run-of-river hydropower and electricity systems planning in Switzerland".

The structure of the repository is as follows:
- `src` contains the main functions and classes to process and analyze the data.
- `notebooks` contains the Jupyter Notebooks used to showcase the figures and analysis present in the paper.

A `data` folder can be downloaded separately. Link will be added shortly.
